BILLING PROVIDER INFO & PH #\n\nAncillary codes/services should not be billed on this second claim and will\nnot be payable by an MCO while the member is awaiting placement. Claims containing a\nmixture of administrative days and any other revenue code will be denied. Facilities will use\nBill Type 111 for AD stays under 30 days. The Admission Date on the claim should be the date of\nadmission into the AD stay.\n\nSince the second claim is reimbursable at a per diem rate, when the member remains in\nadministrative day status over 30 days the standard HFS rules for Interim Claims will apply. As\nnoted in the [IAMHP Comprehensive Billing Guide,](https://iamhp.net/resources/Documents/IAMHP_Billing%20Manual_v13.0.pdf) interim claims for inpatient services rendered\nand paid by the per diem reimbursement methodology cannot be split unless the stay exceeds 30\ndays or the patient is transferred to another facility or category of service. Interim claims (BT 112 or\n113) should include all days in the Value Code 80 calculation. The initial claim (BT 111) and interim\nfinal (BT 114) should not include the day of discharge in the Value Code 80 calculation.\n\n##### Billing Scenarios\n\n##### Scenario One:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>IP psych admission 20 days (Jan 1-21)</td>\n<td>Claim 1: BT 111 with DSC of 95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Admit date 1/1/23</td>\n<td>Value Code 80 = 20*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AD Stay for 6 days (Jan 22-28)</td>\n<td>Claim 2: BT 111 with DSC XX(as appropriate)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Admit date 1/22/23</td>\n<td>Value Code 80 = 6*</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nDate of discharge is NOT included in Value Code 80 calculation\n\n## III. Pediatric Services\n### A. Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this section is to outline policies and procedures for billing for pediatric services.\n\n### B. Provider Type\n\nThis section applies to pediatricians in private practice (i.e. not practicing in an FQHC or employed by a\nhospital). Pediatricians practicing in an FQHC, RHC or ERC should refer to that section of the manual.\n\nProviders must have a valid NPI, be registered in the State's IMPACT system as Provider Type 010 or\n016 with the appropriate and corresponding specialties and sub-specialties and include the correct\ntaxonomy code on each claim. For further information, please refer to the Manual's Introduction,\nProvider Types/Category of Service/Taxonomy Codes.\n\n### C. Coding Requirements\n\nClaims should be submitted on a CMS-1500 form or 837P format and follow all guidelines outlined in\nthe Introduction section of this manual. Medicaid MCOs follow NUCC coding guidelines as well as those\nin [Coding for Pediatric Preventive Care published](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Coding%20Preventive%20Care.pdf) by the AAP, except where noted in this manual.\n\nPlease find below tables of Procedure Codes common to pediatric services in use by Illinois Medicaid\nMCOs.

Providers will need to add Modifier 25 for separate\nline item payment.\n\n##### Procedure Codes for Approved Risk Assessment Tools\n\nNOTE: Effective with dates of service beginning April 1, 2023, one of the following G codes must be used for any depression\nscreenings instead of 96127:\n\nG8431: Screening for depression is documented as positive and a follow-up plan is documented.\nG8510: Screening for depression is documentd as negative and a follow-up plan is not documented.\n\n## IX. Ambulatory Surgical Treatment Centers (ASTCs)\n### A. Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this section is to outline the billing policies and procedures related to Ambulatory\nSurgical Treatment Centers (ASTCs).\n\n### B. Provider Type\n\nThe ASTC section applies to Provider Type 046 - ASTC.\n\n### C. IMPACT Enrollment Requirements\n\nThe provider must be a registered provider of ASTC services in the HFS IMPACT system with a specialty\nof Ambulatory Surgical Treatment Center and a sub-specialty of Outpatient Surgery with the taxonomy\ncode 261QA1903X.\n\n### D. Billing Requirements\n#### i. Covered Services\n\nFacility services furnished by an ASTC include, but are not limited to:\n\n· Nursing, technician and related services;\n\n· Use of the ASTC facility;\n\n· Supplies such as drugs, biologicals (e.g., blood), surgical dressings, splints, casts and appliances\nand equipment directly related to the provision of surgical procedures;\n\n· Diagnostic or therapeutic services or items directly related to the provision of a surgical\nprocedure;\n\n· Administrative, record-keeping and housekeeping items and services; and\n\n· Materials for anesthesia.\n\nASTCs shall not provide beds or other accommodations for the overnight stay of patients. However,\nfacilities devoted exclusively to the treatment of children may provide accommodations and beds for\ntheir patients up to 23 hours following admission.\n\nSupplies and equipment used by the ASTC for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient during the\nASTC surgical visit are included in the ASTC's all-inclusive visit/rate. Drugs dispensed for treatment or\ndiagnostic purposes during the ASTC surgical visit and dispensed for take home purposes shall be\nincluded in the approved per visit rate.\n\n##### a) Non-Facility Services\n\nFacility services that are not considered facility services (e.g. physician services, laboratory, X-ray, or\ndiagnostic procedures performed by independent facilities or practitioners) must be billed by the\nprovider rendering such services on a fee-for-service basis. However, if the ASTC provides the lab or X-\nray service, the facility may not bill separately if the lab or x-ray service was provided on the day of the\nsurgery. The ASTC may bill separately if the lab or X-ray service was provided on a date other than\nthe date of the surgery.\n\nAdditional information on covered services can be found on the IL HFS website in the [ASTC Handbook.](https://hfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/hfs/sitecollectiondocuments/g200.pdf)\n\n##### b) Claim Form\n\nASTC services must be submitted on a UB-04 claim form or using the 837I electronic claim format and\nalso include Type of Bill 83X.\n\nAmbulatory Procedures Listing (APL): Note APL Section applies prior to 7/01/2020 DOS only.\n\nThe APL is a compilation of procedures that have been determined by HFS to be either unique to or\nmost appropriately provided in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgical treatment center\nsetting. Not all procedures will be applicable to the services provided in an ASTC. Services in\naccordance with covered Ambulatory Procedures Listing (APL) codes are eligible to be billed. An\noutpatient ASTC claim must contain at least one procedure code listed in the APL.\n\nWhen any service listed in the APL is performed on a given day, all services provided on that day must\nbe billed on a single outpatient institutional claim.\n\nFailure to have an APL code, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), ED revenue code,\nand/or OBV revenue code on the claim will result in the rejection of entire claim.\n\n##### c) Enhanced Ambulatory Patient Grouping (EAPG)\n\nEffective with dates of service beginning July 1, 2014, all outpatient hospital and ASTC claims are\ngrouped and priced through 3M™ Enhanced Ambulatory Patient Grouping System (EAPG) software or\nsimilar MCO grouper software. The all-inclusive EAPG PPS payment is considered to cover all services\nprovided by salaried ASTC personnel, all drugs administered and/or provided for take home use, all\nequipment and supplies used for diagnosis and/or treatment on the ASTC premises, and all X-ray,\nlaboratory and therapy provided to the patient on the same day.\n\n### E. Service Limitations and Requirements\n#### i. Hysterectomy\n\nA hysterectomy is a covered service only when it is done for medical reasons and is not done solely to\naccomplish sterilization. A claim will only be processed if the information on the completed [Form 1977](https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/SiteCollectionDocuments/hfs1977.pdf)\n[Acknowledgement of Receipt of Hysterectomy Information indicates](https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/SiteCollectionDocuments/hfs1977.pdf) that the patient was informed\nthat the hysterectomy will render her permanently incapable of reproducing. Completion of this form\nis required regardless of age. The UB-04 claim (indicating a hysterectomy was performed) with the HFS\n1977 attached must be sent together to the MCO for the claim to be processed.\n\n#### ii.
