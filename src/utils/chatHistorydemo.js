      "### Reimbursement Process for T1015\n\nCPT code **T1015** is used for **Encounter Rate** billing by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Rural Health Centers (RHCs), and Encounter Rate Clinics. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of the reimbursement process for T1015:\n\n#### 1. **Claim Submission**\n   - Claims must be submitted with **T1015** as the primary encounter rate code on the first service line of the claim.\n   - The clinic's assigned encounter rate must be included in the claim submission.\n   - Additional CPT codes for services rendered during the encounter should be listed in the remaining service lines as detail codes. These detail codes will be reimbursed at **$0.00**.\n\n#### 2. **Detail Codes**\n   - Detail codes should include all services provided as part of a billable encounter. This ensures that all services are documented, even if they do not contribute to the reimbursement amount.\n\n#### 3. **Reimbursement Rates**\n   - The reimbursement for T1015 is based on the clinic's assigned encounter rate, which varies by provider and is determined by the Medicaid managed care organization (MCO).\n   - Providers should refer to their MCO's fee schedule for the specific encounter rate applicable to their services.\n\n#### 4. **Billing for Multiple Services**\n   - If multiple services are provided during the encounter, they should be documented with the appropriate detail codes, but only the encounter rate (T1015) will be reimbursed.\n\n#### 5. **Telehealth Encounters**\n   - For telehealth services, T1015 can also be billed as the encounter code, with appropriate modifiers and place of service codes indicating the nature of the telehealth encounter.\n\n#### 6. **Claim Processing**\n   - Claims are processed based on the eligibility of the member and the provider's contract with the MCO.\n   - Clean claims are typically processed within **30 days**, while most claims should be processed within **90 days**.\n\n#### 7. **Common Reasons for Claim Denial**\n   - Claims may be denied for reasons such as:\n     - Missing or incorrect patient information\n     - Incorrect coding or missing detail codes\n     - Claims submitted without the required encounter rate code\n\n#### 8. **Resubmission of Denied Claims**\n   - If a claim is denied, providers can resubmit a corrected claim within **6 months** from the date of service.\n   - The resubmission should include a note indicating it is a correction, along with any necessary supporting documentation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reimbursement process for CPT code **T1015** involves submitting claims with the encounter rate code, including detail codes for services rendered, and adhering to the specific billing guidelines set by the Medicaid managed care organization.
